# Asking quality questions

Here are some tips:

* [Talk to a duck!](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
* Don’t fall for the [XY problem][(https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378)
* Search to find out if a similar question has been asked
* Try to define what you need help with:
  * Is there something in particular you want to do?
  * What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  * Is there a concept you don’t understand?
* Provide sample code, if possible
* Screenshots can help, but if there’s important text such as code or error messages in them, please also provide those as text
